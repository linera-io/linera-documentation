# Writing Linera Applications

In this section, we'll be exploring how to create Web3 applications using the Linera SDK.

We'll use a simple "counter" application as a running example.

We'll focus on the back end of the application, which consists of two main parts: a _smart
contract_ and its GraphQL service.

Both the contract and the service of an application are written in Rust using the crate
[`linera-sdk`](https://crates.io/crates/linera-sdk), and compiled to Wasm bytecode.

This section should be seen as a guide versus a reference manual for the SDK. For the
reference manual, refer to the [documentation of the
crate](https://docs.rs/linera-sdk/latest/linera_sdk/).
