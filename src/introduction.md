# The Linera Manual

Welcome to the reference manual of Linera, the decentralized protocol for
**real-time Web3 applications**.

This documentation is split into three main parts:

1. The first section gives a [high-level overview](protocol/overview.md) of the
   protocol.

2. The second section is intended for
   [developers](developers/getting_started.md) building applications using the
   Linera Rust SDK.

3. The third section is intended for [operators](operators/devnets.md) who wish
   to run Linera validators.

> **NEW: Publish and test your Web3 application on the Linera Testnet!**
>
> Install
> [the Linera CLI tool](developers/getting_started/installation.html#installing-from-cratesio)
> then follow the instructions on
> [this page](developers/getting_started/hello_linera.html#using-the-testnet) to
> claim a microchain and publish your first application on the current Testnet.
