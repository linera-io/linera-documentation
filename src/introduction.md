# The Linera Manual

Welcome to the Linera manual, a decentralized protocol designed for **highly
scalable, low-latency Web3 applications**.

The documentation is split into two parts:

1. The [Developers](developers.md) section is intended for developers who wish
   to learn more about Linera and its programming model by prototyping
   applications using the Linera Rust SDK.
2. The [Operators](operators.md) section is intended for operators who wish to
   run Linera validators.

> **NEW: Publish and test your Web3 application on the Linera Devnet!**
>
> Install
> [the Linera CLI tool](developers/getting_started/installation.html#installing-from-cratesio)
> then follow the instructions on
> [this page](developers/getting_started/hello_linera.html#using-the-devnet) to
> claim a microchain and publish your first application on the current Devnet.
