# The Linera Developer Manual

Welcome to the developer manual of Linera, a decentralized protocol designed for
**highly scalable, low-latency Web3 applications**.

This documentation is intended for developers who wish to learn more about
Linera and its programming model by prototyping applications on top of the
Linera Rust SDK.

> **NEW: Publish and test your Web3 application on the Linera Devnet!**
>
> Install
> [the Linera CLI tool](http://localhost:3000/getting_started/installation.html#installing-from-cratesio)
> then follow the instructions on
> [this page](http://localhost:3000/getting_started/hello_linera.html#using-the-devnet)
> to claim a microchain and publish your first application on the current
> Devnet.
