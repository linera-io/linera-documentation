# Introduction

Welcome to the developer documentation of Linera, **a decentralized protocol
designed for highly scalable Web3 applications**.

Linera is currently under
[active development](overview.html#what-is-the-current-state-of-the-development-of-linera).
This documentation is intended for developers who wish to learn more about
Linera and its programming model by prototyping applications on top of the
current Software Development Kit (SDK).

We assume that you have a basic understanding of blockchain technology,
decentralized applications, and smart contract development. We will provide
detailed guides and examples to help you build, test, and deploy your demo
applications on your machine in a local instance of the Linera protocol.

We encourage you to join our community and get involved in the development of
the Linera ecosystem. You can find more information on our
[website](https://linera.io) and on social media channels, including
