# Introduction

Welcome to the developer documentation of Linera, an integrated multi-chain decentralized
protocol designed for highly-scalable web3 applications.

Please note that the Linera protocol is currently under active development. This
documentation is intended for developers who wish to learn more about Linera and its
programming model by building applications on top of the current Software Development Kit
(SDK).

We assume that you have a good understanding of blockchain technology, decentralized
applications, and smart contract development. We will provide detailed guides and examples
to help you build, test, and deploy your demo applications on your machine in a local
instance of the Linera protocol.

We encourage you to join our community and get involved in the development of the Linera
ecosystem. You can find more information on our website and social media channels. Let's
get started!
