# Introduction

Welcome to the developer documentation of Linera, **a decentralized protocol designed for
highly scalable Web3 applications**.

Linera is currently under [active development](overview.html#what-is-the-current-state-of-the-development-of-linera). This documentation is intended for
developers who wish to learn more about Linera and its programming model by prototyping
applications on top of the current Software Development Kit (SDK).

We assume that you have a basic understanding of blockchain technology, decentralized
applications, and smart contract development. We will provide detailed guides and examples
to help you build, test, and deploy your demo applications on your machine in a local
instance of the Linera protocol.

We encourage you to join our community and get involved in the development of the Linera
ecosystem. You can find more information on our [website](https://linera.io) and on social
media channels, including [twitter](https://twitter.com/linera_io), [telegram](https://t.me/linera_official), and [discord](https://discord.gg/linera).

_Let's get started!_
