# Getting started

Linera's SDK is a development kit that enables developers to build decentralized applications on top of the Linera protocol. It includes tools, libraries, and documentation to help developers write, test, and deploy smart contracts, as well as front-end applications.

The SDK includes the following components:

- Linera Core: The core blockchain protocol that handles consensus, transaction processing, and state management. The Linera Core is responsible for maintaining the integrity and security of the network.

- Smart Contract Language: Linera supports smart contracts written in Rust, AssemblyScript, and other languages that can compile to WebAssembly.

- Development Tools: The SDK includes tools for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts, including a development environment, a command-line interface (CLI), and a web-based user interface.

- Developer Documentation: The SDK includes comprehensive documentation for developers, including tutorials, code samples, and API reference documentation.

## Getting Started with Linera's SDK

To get started with Linera's SDK, you will need to install the Linera CLI and set up a local development environment. The Linera CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with the Linera protocol, deploy contracts, and manage your local node.

Once you have installed the Linera CLI and set up your development environment, you can start building smart contracts and front-end applications using the tools and libraries provided by the SDK.
