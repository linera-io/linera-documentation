# Validators

Validators run the servers that allow users to download and create blocks. They
validate, execute and cryptographically certify the blocks of all the chains.

> In Linera, every chain is backed by the same set of validators and has the
> same level of security.

The main function of validators is to guarantee the integrity of the
infrastructure in the sense that:

- Each block is valid, i.e. it has the correct format, its operations are
  allowed, the received messages are in the correct order, and e.g. the balance
  was correctly computed.

- Every message received by one chain was actually sent by another chain.

- If one block on a particular height is certified, no other block on the same
  height is.

These properties are guaranteed to hold as long as two third of the validators
(weighted by their stake) follow the protocol. In the future, deviating from the
protocol may cause a validator to be considered malicious and to lose their
_stake_.

Validators also play a role in the liveness of the system by making sure that
the history of the chains stays available. However, since validators do not
propose blocks on most chains (see [next section](block_creation.html)), they do
_not_ guarantee that any particular operation or message will eventually be
executed on a chain. Instead, chain owners decide whether and when to propose
new blocks, and which operations and messages to include. The current
implementation of the Linera client automatically includes all incoming messages
in new blocks. The operations are the actions the chain owner explicitly adds,
e.g. transfer.

## Architecture of a validator

Since every chain uses the same validators, adding more chains does not require
adding validators. Instead, it requires each individual validator to scale out
by adding more computation units, also known as "workers" or "physical shards".

In the end, a Linera validator resembles a Web2 service made of

- a load balancer (aka. ingress/egress), currently implemented by the binary
  `linera-proxy`,

- a number of workers, currently implemented by the binary `linera-server`,

- a shared database, currently implemented by the abstract interface
  `linera-storage`.

```

Inside a validator, components communicate using the internal network of the
validator. Notably, workers use direct Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) with each
other to deliver cross-chain messages.

Note that the number of workers may vary for each validator. Both the load
balancer and the shared database are represented as a single entity but are
meant to scale out in production.

> For local testing during development, we currently use a single worker and
> RocksDB as a database.

## Configuring Networks, Workers, and Proxies

In [a previous section](../getting_started/hello_linera.md), we used the
`linera net up` command to start a local network. This should be sufficient for
most use cases when you're running a local network.

```bash
linera net up
```

However, it is possible to customize and configure the parameters of the
network.

To do this, you need the `linera-protocol` repository and the
`./scripts/run_local.sh` script.

`run_local.sh` uses the `validator_n.toml` file from the `configuration/`
directory to configure validator number `n`.

```bash
linera-server generate --validators configuration/validator_{1,2,3,4}.toml --committee committee.json
```

generates keys and writes them, together with the options from the TOML files,
to `server_1.json`, ..., `server_4.json`. It also stores the set of the new
validators' public keys in `committee.json`.

```bash
linera --wallet wallet.json --storage rocksdb:linera.db create-genesis-config 10 --genesis genesis.json --initial-funding 10 --committee committee.json
```

creates a configuration for the initial state of the network, `genesis.json`,
with 10 chains, each with a balance of 10. It also creates a `wallet.json` for a
client who owns all those chains and initializes the corresponding local node
`linera.db`.

To start the newly configured network, each validator `n` must start their
proxy:

```bash
linera-proxy server_n.json &
```

And all shards; for shard `i`:

```bash
linera-server run --storage rocksdb:server_n_i.db --server server_n.json --shard i --genesis genesis.json &
```

This will create a separate database file `server_n_i.db` for each shard. In a
production network, these would be running on different machines.

## Changing the Set of Validators

If a new validator wants to start participating, or an old one wants to leave,
all chains must be updated.

The system has one designated _admin chain_, where the validators can join or
leave, and where new _epochs_ are defined. During every epoch, the set of
validators is fixed. If you own the admin chain, you can use the `set-validator`
and `remove-validator` commands to start a new epoch with a modified set of
validators:

```bash
linera --wallet wallet.json set-validator --name 5b611b86cc1f54f73a4abfb4a2167c7327cc85a74cb2a5502431f67b554850b4 --address 127.0.0.1:9100 --votes 3
linera --wallet wallet.json remove-validator --name f65a585f05852f0610e2460a99c23faa3969f3cfce8a519f843a793dbfb4cb84
```

Chain owners must then create a block that receives the `SetCommittees` message
from the admin chain, and have it certified by the old validators. Only the
_next_ block in their chain will be certified by the new validator set!

The _admin chain_ is currently managed by a single user. In the future, it will
be a _public chain_ (i.e. managed by validators). We anticipate that Linera
epochs will change once per day (or less) and that several subsequent epochs
will overlap so that chain owners have enough time to migrate their chains.
(Chain migration may also be delegated to third parties. See
[next section](block_creation.html).)
