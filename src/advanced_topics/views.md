# Views

Views are a specific functionality of the Linera system that allow to have data in memory
and then seamlessly flush it to an underlying persistent datastore.

The [full documentation](https://docs.rs/linera-views/latest/linera_views/) is available on the crate documentation with all functions having
examples.

Concretely, what is provided is the following:

- A trait `View` that provides `load`, `rollback`, `clear`, `flush`, `delete`. The idea
  is that we can do operation on the data and then flush it to the database storing them.
- Several other traits `HashableView`, `RootView`, `CryptoHashView`, `CryptoHashRootView`
  that are important for computing hash.
- A number of standard containers: `MapView`, `SetView`, `LogView`, `QueueView`, `RegisterView`
  that implement the `View` and `HashableView` traits.
- Two containers `CollectionView` and `ReentrantCollectionView` that are similar to `MapView` but
  whose values are views themselves.
- Derive macros that allow to implement the above mentioned traits on struct data types whose
  entries are views.
