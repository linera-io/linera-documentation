# Writing Linera application frontends

Linera comes with a Web client library that supports calling
applications using a JavaScript API directly inside Web pages.

After you complete this section, you'll know how to build highly
reactive frontends for Linera applications.

We're going to be building a frontend for the `counter` example we
covered in [Writing Application Backends](backends.md), so make sure
to either complete that first or deploy the completed application from
the `linera-protocol` `examples` directory.
