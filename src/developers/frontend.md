# Writing Linera application frontends

Linera comes with a Web client library that supports calling
applications using a JavaScript API directly inside Web pages.

After you complete this section, you'll know how to build interactive
frontends for Linera applications, taking advantage of Linera's push
notifications to implement realtime reactivity.

We're going to be building a frontend for the `counter` example we
covered in [Writing Application Backends](backend.md), so make sure to
either complete that first or deploy the completed application from
the `linera-protocol` `examples` directory and take a note of the
resulting application ID.
