# Why build on top of Linera?

## Real-time interactions at scale

At Linera, we believe that Web3 applications should be able to serve as many
**active users** as needed without degrading user experience and security.

Examples of applications that require processing time-sensitive transactions
created by many simultaneous users (or devices) include:

- Real-time payments and micro-rewards,

- Real-time auction systems,

- Turn-based on-chain games,

- Decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN),

- Social data feeds,

- Version control systems for software, data pipelines, or AI training
  pipelines.

## Real-time connectivity and off-chain integrations

In addition to real-time cases, Linera's unique concept of **user chains** facilitate
communications with external systems in several ways:

- Transactions can query external Web services, including AI inference systems
  or RPC providers from other blockchains.

- Transactions can last several seconds (e.g. to download data and apply
  validation functions).

- Linera blocks natively generate proofs of execution suitable for low-latency
  bridges.
