# Testnets

This section discusses how to deploy a validator node and join an existing
Testnet.

In a Testnet, the validator nodes are run by different operators. Testnets will
gain in stability and decentralization over time in preparation of the mainnet
launch. Testnets do not handle real assets.

> In the initial Testnets of Linera, the set of validator nodes will be managed
> by the Linera Core team.
