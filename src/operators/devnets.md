# Devnets

This section discusses how to deploy developer networks, aka "Devnets", for
testing and development purposes.

Devnets always start from a genesis configuration and an empty state. Validator
nodes are usually operated in a single infrastructure for simplicity. Devnets do
not handle real assets.
