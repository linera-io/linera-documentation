# Writing Tests

Linera applications can be tested using unit tests or integration tests. Both are a bit different
than usual Rust tests. Unit tests are executed inside a WebAssembly virtual machine in an
environment that simulates a single microchain and a single application. System APIs are only
available if they are mocked using helper functions from `linera_sdk::test`.

Integration tests run outside a WebAssembly virtual machine, and use a simulated validator for
testing. This allows testing interactions between multiple microchains and multiple applications.
However, it is also more low-level because testing the application requires interacting with
microchains, so execution only happens when blocks are published.

Applications should consider having both types of tests. Unit tests should be used to focus on the
application's internals and core functionality. Integration tests should be used to test how the
application behaves on a more complex environment that's closer to the real network.

## Unit tests

Unit tests can be written beside the application's source code (i.e., inside the `src/` directory of
the project). There are two major differences to normal Rust unit tests:

- `linera project test` is used instead of `cargo test` (or the environment must be configured so that Cargo
  uses a custom test runner, as described [below](#manually-configuring-the-environment));
- the [`#[webassembly_test]`](https://docs.rs/webassembly-test/latest/webassembly_test/) attribute
  is used instead of the usual `#[test]` attribute.

### Manually Configuring the Environment

Running `linera project test` is easier, but if there's a need to run `cargo test` explicitly to run the
unit tests, Cargo must be configured to use the custom `test-runner`. The `test-runner` can be built
from the repository.

```bash
cd linera-protocol
cargo build -p linera-sdk --bin test-runner --release
```

The steps above build the `test-runner` and places the resulting binary at
`linera-protocol/target/release/test-runner`.

With the binary available, the last step is to configure Cargo. There are a few ways to do this. A
quick way is to set the `CARGO_TARGET_WASM32_UNKNOWN_UNKNOWN_RUNNER` environment variable to the
path of the binary. A more persistent way is to change one of [Cargo's configuration
files](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure). As an example,
the following file can be placed inside the project's directory at `PROJECT_DIR/.cargo/config.toml`:

```ignore
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
runner = "PATH_TO/test-runner"
```

After configuring the test runner, unit tests can be executed with

```bash
cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Example

A simple unit test is shown below, which tests if the application's `do_something` method changes
the application state.

```rust,ignore
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::state::ApplicationState;
    use webassembly_test::webassembly_test;

    #[webassembly_test]
    fn test_do_something() {
        let mut application = ApplicationState {
            // Configure the application's initial state
            ..ApplicationState::default()
        };

        let result = application.do_something();

        assert!(result.is_ok());
        assert_eq!(application, ApplicationState {
            // Define the application's expected final state
            ..ApplicationState::default()
        });
    }
}
```

### Mocking System APIs

Unit tests run in a constrained environment, so things like access to the key-value store,
cross-chain messages and cross-application calls can't be executed. However, they can be simulated
using mock APIs. The `linera-sdk::test` module provides some helper functions to mock the system
APIs.

Here's an example mocking the key-value store.

```rust,ignore
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::state::ApplicationState;
    use linera_sdk::test::mock_key_value_store;
    use webassembly_test::webassembly_test;

    #[webassembly_test]
    fn test_state_is_not_persisted() {
        let mut storage = mock_key_value_store();

        // Assuming the application uses views
        let mut application = ApplicationState::load(storage.clone())
            .now_or_never()
            .expect("Mock key-value store returns immediately")
            .expect("Failed to load view from mock key-value store");

        // Assuming `do_something` changes the view, but does not persist it
        let result = application.do_something();

        assert!(result.is_ok());

        // Check that the state in memory is different from the state in storage
        assert_ne!(application, ApplicatonState::load(storage));
    }
}
```

## Integration Tests

Integration tests are usually written separately from the application's source code (i.e., inside a
`tests` directory that's beside the `src` directory). Integration tests are normal Rust integration
tests, and they are compiled to the **host** target instead of the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
used for unit tests. This is because unit tests run inside a WebAssembly virtual machine and
integration tests run outside a virtual machine, starting isolated virtual machines to run each
operation of each block added to each chain.

Integration tests use the helper types from `linera_sdk::test` to set up a simulated Linera network,
and publish blocks to microchains in order to execute the application.

### Example

A simple test that sends a message between application instances on different chains is shown below.

```rust,ignore
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_cross_chain_message() {
    let (validator, application_id) = TestValidator::with_current_application(vec![], vec![]).await;

    let mut sender_chain = validator.get_chain(application_id.creation.chain_id).await;
    let mut receiver_chain = validator.new_chain().await;

    sender_chain
        .add_block(|block| {
            block.with_operation(
                application_id,
                Operation::SendMessageTo(receiver_chain.id()),
            )
        })
        .await;

    receiver_chain.handle_received_messages().await;

    assert_eq!(
        receiver_chain
            .query::<ChainId>(application_id, Query::LastSender)
            .await,
        sender_chain.id(),
    );
}
```
