# Deploying the Application

The first step to deploy your application is to configure a wallet. This will
determine where the application will be deployed: either to a local net or to
the devnet.

## Local Net

To configure the local network, follow the steps in the
[Getting Started section](../getting_started/hello_linera.html#using-the-initial-test-wallet).

Afterwards, the `LINERA_WALLET` and the `LINERA_STORAGE` environment variables
should be set and can be used in the `publish-and-create` command to deploy the
application while also specifying:

1. The location of the contract bytecode
2. The location of the service bytecode
3. The JSON encoded initialization arguments

```bash
linera publish-and-create \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my-counter_{contract,service}.wasm \
  --json-argument "42"
```

## Devnet

To configure the wallet for the devnet while creating a new microchain, the
following command can be used:

```bash
linera wallet init --with-new-chain --faucet https://faucet.{{#include ../../RELEASE_BRANCH}}.linera.net
```

The Faucet will provide the new chain with some tokens, which can then be used
to deploy the application with the `publish-and-create` command. It requires
specifying:

1. The location of the contract bytecode
2. The location of the service bytecode
3. The JSON encoded initialization arguments

```bash
linera publish-and-create \
  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/my-counter_{contract,service}.wasm \
  --json-argument "42"
```

## Interacting with the Application

To interact with the deployed application, a
[node service](../core_concepts/node_service.html) must be used.
