# Cross-Application Calls

An application can send messages (of type `ContractAbi::Effect`) to its own instances on
other chains. In the `fungible` example application, such a message can be the transfer
of tokens from one chain to another: `Credit { owner: AccountOwner, amount: Amount }`.
Cross-chain messages sent by an application on one chain will always be handled by the
_same_ application on the target chain. The application state on that chain may be
different, but the code will be the same.

Cross-_application_ calls, on the other hand, are calls from one application to a different
application on the same chain, using the `call_application` method:

```rust,ignore
async fn call_application<A: ContractAbi + Send>(
    &mut self,
    authenticated: bool,
    application: ApplicationId<A>,
    call: &A::ApplicationCall,
    forwarded_sessions: Vec<SessionId>,
) -> Result<(A::Response, Vec<SessionId>), Self::Error>
```

The `authenticated` argument specifies whether the callee is allowed to perform actions
that require authentication on behalf of the signer of the original block that caused this
call.

The `application` argument is the callee's application ID, and `A` is the callee's ABI.

`call` are the arguments of the application call, in a type defined by the callee.

`forwarded_sessions` are session data that need to be consumed within this transaction.
Sessions will be explained in a separate section.

## Example: Crowd-Funding

The `crowd-funding` example application allows the application creator to launch a
campaign with a funding target. That target can be an amount specified in any type of
token based on the `fungible` application. Others can then pledge tokens of that type
to the campaign, and if the target is not reached by the deadline, they are refunded.

If Alice used the `fungible` example to create a Pugecoin application (with an
impressionable pug as its mascot), then Bob can create a `crowd-funding` application,
use Pugecoin's application ID as `CrowdFundingAbi::Parameters`, and specify in
`CrowdFundingAbi::InitializationArgument` that his campaign will run for one week and
has a target of 1000 Pugecoins.

Now let's say Carol wants to pledge 10 Pugecoin tokens to Bob's campaign.

First she needs to make sure she has his crowd-funding application on her chain, e.g.
using the `linera request-application` command. This will automatically also register
Alice's application on her chain, because it is a dependency of Bob's.

Now she can make her pledge by running the `linera service` and making a query to Bob's
application:

```json
mutation { pledgeWithTransfer(owner: "User:841â€¦6c0", amount: "10") }
```

This will add a block to Carol's chain containing the pledge operation that gets handled
by `CrowdFunding::execute_operation`, resulting in one cross-application call and two
cross-chain messages:

First `CrowdFunding::execute_operation` calls the `fungible` application on Carol's chain
to transfer 10 tokens to Carol's account on Bob's chain:

```rust,ignore
self.call_application(
    true,                 // The call is authenticated by Carol, who signed this block.
    Self::fungible_id()?, // The Pugecoin application ID.
    &fungible::ApplicationCall::Transfer {
        owner,            // Carol
        amount,           // 10 tokens
        destination,      // Bob's chain.
    },
    vec![],
).await?;
```

This causes `Fungible::handle_application_call` to be run, which will create a cross-chain
message sending the amount 10 to the Pugecoin application instance on Bob's chain.

After the cross-application call returns, `CrowdFunding::execute_operation` continues to
create another cross-chain message `crowd_funding::Effect::PledgeWithAccount`, which
informs the crowd-funding application on Bob's chain that the 10 tokens are meant for
the campaign.

When Bob now adds a block to his chain that handles the two incoming messages,
first `Fungible::execute_effect` gets executed, and then `CrowdFunding::execute_effect`.
The latter makes another cross-application call to transfer the 10 tokens from Carol's
account to the crowd-funding application's account (both on Bob's chain). That is
successful because Carol does now have 10 tokens on this chain and she authenticated
the transfer indirectly by signing her block. The crowd-funding application now makes a
note in its application state on Bob's chain that Carol has pledged 10 Pugecoin tokens.

For the complete code please take a look at the `crowd-funding` and `fungible`
applications in the `examples` folder in `linera-protocol`.
